"""Meetinghouse: an online emulation of a Quaker Meeting for Business.

The Meetinghouse has three subsections that share common Topic/Poll
mechanics: Forum (ordinary decisions), Rules (changing the Rules
themselves), and Jury (temporarily dismissing a Participant).

Time is passed in explicitly as a `now` argument to every action,
rather than read from the system clock inside this module. A caller
(a web handler, a periodic job, a test) supplies `now`; this keeps the
whole engine deterministic and easy to test by simply constructing
later datetimes, and keeps scheduling, persistence, and delivery of
the Daily Summary as someone else's job.

A few places in the design spec were ambiguous and required a
judgment call, documented at the point of the decision:

* A Rule is modeled as four numbers per subsection (quiet time,
  minimum life, and the two pass-criteria fractions), since those are
  the only Rule properties the spec actually quantifies.
* Revoking a Vote does not restart the Quiet-time clock, since it is a
  withdrawal of activity rather than new activity.
* "Voters" are distinct Participants with a live vote of any choice;
  "Readers" include anyone who has read the Topic or voted on it.
* A Topic/Poll with no Readers, or no live votes, FAILS rather than
  raising an error.
