"""The close-and-persist flow behind Meetinghouse.Tick().

Factored out of app.py so it can run two ways in production: inside
the Flask process on hosts that can keep a background thread alive,
or as a one-shot cron invocation (see tick.py) on hosts like TigerTech
shared hosting, where a FastCGI worker's lifetime isn't ours to
control and a thread inside it can't be relied on to keep running.
